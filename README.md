# BlueChips - Digital Asset Analysis with STARK-verifiable Technology

## Overview

BlueChips is an integrated digital asset analysis platform that leverages STARK-verifiable technology to generate verifiable predictions for BTC and ETH market movements. The platform consists of three main components:

1. **[xgb2cairo](./xgb2cairo/)**: A utility that converts trained XGBoost models to Cairo code for STARK-verifiable applications.
2. **[BlueChipAI API](./bluechipai/)**: A REST API that provides BTC and ETH price predictions based on the Cairo-transpiled models.
3. **[auto-swap-runner](./auto-swap-runner/)**: A background service that periodically queries the prediction API and automatically executes asset operations using the AVNU SDK when positive signals are detected.

## Components

### 1. xgb2cairo

A tool that transpiles trained XGBoost models to executable Cairo code, specifically designed for BTC and ETH price prediction models.

**Key Features:**
- Converts XGBoost models to Cairo code with Fixed Point 32x32 representation
- Generates Scarb project structure for Cairo execution
- Includes validation tools to ensure model accuracy after transpilation

**Technologies:**
- Python 3.11.5
- XGBoost 2.1.3
- Cairo 2.11.4
- Scarb 2.11.4

### 2. BlueChipAI API

A Python-based REST API that integrates external market data with Cairo-based models to provide verifiable, proof-generating predictions for BTC and ETH buy signals in real-time.

**Key Features:**
- Fetches price time series data for BTC and ETH from external sources
- Processes data through STARK-verifiable ML models implemented in Cairo
- Exposes prediction endpoints through a REST API

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/v1/predictions/<asset>` - Get predictions for a specific asset (BTC or ETH)
- `/api/v1/predictions/all` - Get predictions for both BTC and ETH
- `/api/v1/predictions/<asset>/features` - Get the lagged return features for an asset

**Technologies:**
- Python 3.12+
- Cairo 2.11.4
- Scarb 2.11.4

### 3. auto-swap-runner

A lightweight, resource-efficient background service in TypeScript that queries the BlueChipAI prediction API and, upon receiving an affirmative signal, executes a swap action using the AVNU SDK on StarkNet.

**Key Features:**
- Runs as a background process, waking up only at configured intervals
- Configurable through environment variables
- Minimal resource usage with no busy-waiting
- Transparent logging of all operations and errors

**Technologies:**
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- AVNU SDK for StarkNet

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (for xgb2cairo and BlueChipAI)
- Node.js and pnpm (for auto-swap-runner)
- Cairo 2.11.4 and Scarb 2.11.4
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.11.4
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bluechips
   ```

2. Set up each component following their individual README instructions.

## Workflow

1. **Model Transpilation**: Use xgb2cairo to convert trained XGBoost models to Cairo code.
2. **API Deployment**: Deploy the BlueChipAI API which uses the transpiled Cairo models.
3. **Automated Operations**: Configure and run the auto-swap-runner to periodically check for market signals and execute asset operations.
